This a 68% board, like a tada or sabre.

This supports three layouts:

[Compat](https://goo.gl/bRej9A): This format requires a 1.75u right shift, but retains 1.25u FN keys ([json data](compat.json))
![compat.jpg](compat.jpg "compatible style layout")

[Wide](https://goo.gl/vnWaaw): This removes the ugly gap between FN and cursor, but does it by requiring odd-sized 1.5u FN keys ([json data](wide.json))

[Narrow](https://goo.gl/9U5wPm): This keeps more meta keys to the right of the space bar, but requires 1u FN keys ([json data](narrow.json))
